<h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
<p>Command Recommender - Data Collector is designed to have a minimal impact on user
experience. The impact on performance is negligible.</p>

<p>Once installed, the Data Collector immediately starts
monitoring your use of Eclipse. In particular, it takes note of the
views, editors, perspectives, and commands that you use. It also keeps
track of when you bring the Eclipse workbench window into focus. At a
lower level, the Data Collector records the bundles (plug-ins)
that are loaded by Eclipse. The information collected amounts to the id
of the entity (view, editor, perspective, etc.), the symbolic name and
version of the bundle that contains the entity, and the time of the
event.</p>

<p>We recognize that the data collected may contain sensitive
information. Symbolic names for bundles can potentially include company
and product names; bundle versions, as well as view, editor, and
perspective ids could potentially also contain sensitive information.
With this in mind, the Data Collector includes a filtering
framework that can be used to restrict the type of information that is
uploaded.</p>

<p>After a configurable period of time (five days by default)
passes, it asks you for permission to upload.</p>

<!-- TODO: update image -->
<p align="center"><img src="UploadWiz.png" /></p>

<p>At this point, you can tell the Data Collector what you want to
do:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Upload now</em> tells the Data Collector to upload the
	data that has been captured to date. After the same configurable period
	of time passes, you will be asked again.</li>

	<li><em>Upload always</em> tells the Data Collector to upload the
	data that has been captured to date and not ask again. Henceforth, the
	data will be uploaded without asking.</li>

	<li><em>Don't upload</em> tells the Data Collector not to upload
	the data that has been captured. After that same configurable period of
	time passes, you will be asked again. All the data collected to this
	point will be retained.</li>

	<li><em>Never Upload</em> tells the Data Collector not to
	upload the data and to stop collecting the data altogether. This turns
	off the data collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>The period of time between requests to upload the usage data can be
configured by changing the &quot;Upload Period&quot; field on the
&quot;Command Recommender | Storage and Uploading&quot; preferences page.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="UploadingPrefs.png" /></p>

<p>The target for uploads is a server hosted by University of British Columbia
or any other compatible server you specify. The server location can be customized
on the same preference page shown above. The server and related databases will
use the uploaded data to determine helpful commands to recommend back</p>

<p>A copy of the uploaded data is also stored locally. You can use the 
&quot;Local Storage&quot; section of the preferences page shown above to 
clear these data, or change the storage location.</p>

<p>Two different keys are used to identify the source of the uploaded
data. The first key identifies the workstation; this key is stored
locally in your &quot;user home&quot; directory. The second key
identifies the workspace; this key is stored in the <em><?= $tempdir ?></em>
directory for the workspace. These keys are uploaded along with the
usage data.</p>
